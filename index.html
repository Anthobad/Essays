            <b>T</b>he wind was howling through the naked trees, limbs snapping and dry leaves crunching as it accelerated. The thunder yelling was louder than ever, the lightning flashing closer to the deafening thunder than ever before. Moans, growls, and jolts, as though a warning from the heavens. The sky expanded. Rain falls so hard that the leaves scatter like gunshots across a flock of doves.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A</b>ll of a sudden, "BOOM," thunder roared through the whole country. I felt like something strange had just happened. The whole house just shook.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>I</b> was alone at home, preparing the table for supper, when a chair close to me glided in my direction and leaned back as if a transparent host was welcoming me. My heart began to race. My panic began to build. A fresh and cool breeze went through me. It took all in me not to throw myself back into my room.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A</b>fter finishing supper, I walked upstairs to retrieve my flute. I groaned with each creak of the ancient-wrapped steps. My boots quaking, I continued the walk to my room. While grabbing the flute from the dimly lit chamber, I heard someone knocking on the window, encouraging me to run down to the salon. I sat on the couch, opened my notebook, and began to play a beautiful and tranquil song. A few seconds later, I felt the cold breeze moving through me again and heard creaks on the chair facing me. Then all of the lights were extinguished by a bolt of lightning and thunder claps. My heart missed a beat. I stopped to play. Suddenly, someone started to clap. Tension began to build. I closed my eyes, then I remembered that I lived alone. I began to hear noises. "Violin," I said. I was hearing violin chords vibrating near me in a slow rhythm. The tone had shifted from solemn to flippant.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>T</b>hen I opened my eyes and saw my violin floating in the air, playing by itself. Terrified, my screams were louder than the melody playing. I stood up and dropped the flute with my bare foot.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>W</b>ith my blood flowing cold, I dashed up the stairs, entered my room, shut the door, grabbed my phone, and laid on the bed, clenching it, ready to contact 911. I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed. I couldn’t sleep. I’d been scared before, but nothing compared to the horror that coursed through my veins on this terrible night.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A</b>fter a few moments, there was complete silence throughout the house; no more noises, not even water droplets crashing on the window. Creaks, creak after creak, someone was approaching the room. Scratches on the door, the knob was moving. It immediately called the authorities. Toot, toot, no one answered. "Who are you?" I asked, silence. Nobody answered.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>S</b>uddenly, the door opened and then closed, but no one entered. With the help of a lightning stroke, I saw in the corner of my vision the faded shadow of a man standing in the center of the room. I got choked. Suddenly, the invisible man had thrown himself on me.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>T</b>he next day, in the early morning, the authorities entered the house and searched but found no one. The house was empty.
